## Introduction
This is my latest modified code for the Pixel Art Maker project. The project represents a web page that coulb be used to create a customized grid based on the user input. 
## Instructions

The user inputs the desired grid hight and length, and the grid will be created upon pressing the submit botton. The user can then click on the each cell on the grid to change it's color, the color of the specific cell clicked will only change. The color can be changed any time using by clicking on the color tab under the "Pick a Color" heading. 

The Grid can be reseted by pressing the submit boton at any time.

## Contributing
